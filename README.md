<h1 align="center">Whitelist</h1>
<br>

A robust system for aggregating, categorizing, and managing personal whitelists. It provides a structured, easily navigable collection of trusted domains, for a **minimal** unblocking of services. To be used only as a baseline, can be region specific.

Want to report a new domain? Want to report existing one? Feel free to file an issue.
